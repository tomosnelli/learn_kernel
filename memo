pointers are registers that hold data
it keeps an address to memory in it

jumps:
jumps can be used to jump to different parts of code base on labels.
They are used to divert program flow.

the general format of the jump is:
jmp label
	_start:
		jmp _start
this makes and infinite loop
and this will load the address for _start label in to rip(pointer) register
it holds the address for the next instruction

comparisons
use cmp for comparisons...
syntax should be comp register(name), register(name)/value
	cmp rax, 23
	cmp rax, rbx
After the comparison is done, certain flags will get set
example:
	a == b		ZF = 1  flag(type of register) will be set to 1
	a != b		ZF = 0  flag(type of register) will be set to 0
and.. after a comparison is made, a conditional jump can be made.
conditional jumps are based on the status of the flags
conditional jumps in code are written just like unconditional jumps, however
"jmp" is replaced by the symbol for the conditional jump.

conditional jump Examples
	cmp rax, 23
	je _doThis
je => jump equals. So if the values are equal a jump will happen

or
	cmp rax, rbx
	jg _doThis
jg => jump greater? so if the value of the value in the rax register is greater than the value in the rbx register.

Registers as Pointers
the default registers can be treated as pointers.
to treat a register as a pointer, surround the register name with square brackets => rax ===> [rax]

example
mov rax, rbx ; this will load the value in the rbx register into the rax register

mov rax, [rbx] ; this will load the value the rbx register is pointing to the rax register

Calls and jumps
calls and jumps are essentially the same.
However, when "call" is used, the original position the call was made can be returned to using "ret".

Example:

section .data
	text db "Hello, World!", 10 ; 10 is a new line character \n
section .text
	global _start
_start:
	call _printHello

	mov rax, 60
	mov rdi, 0
	syscall

Math operations
math operations are used to mathematically manipulate registers.
the form of a math operation is typically:
	operation register, value/register
the first register is the subject of the operation
example:
	add rax, 5 ; value of rax is being incremented
	sub rbx, rax ; rax value will not change, but value of rax will be decremented by rax

math operations list

operation name	 Description
add a, b			a = a + b
sub a, b			a = a - b
mul reg				rax = rax - reg
div reg				rax = rax / reg
neg reg				reg = -reg
inc reg				reg = reg + 1
dec reg				reg = reg - 1
adc a, b			a = a + b + CF(CF is a flag if I remember correctly
sbb a, b			a = a - b - CF
